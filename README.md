# Bayesian Optimization Sources

Recommended step to learn (from easy to detail)

1. Read the [introduction slides](https://github.com/rahmanda/bayesian-optimization-sources/blob/main/GP%20and%20Bayesian%20Optimization_intro.pptx) (from Advanced Topics in Data Science course at UHasselt, credits to Prof. dr. Inneke Van Nieuwenhuyse.)
2. Watch [bayesian optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz3D36VXefI) and [gaussian processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vGiHC35j9s) video from Nando de Freitas
3. Read the book by [Pourmohamad and Lee](https://github.com/rahmanda/bayesian-optimization-sources/blob/main/pourmohamad-lee-bayesian-optimization-with-application-to-computer-experiments.pdf), especially on Appendix where they gave the [R-code implementation](https://github.com/tpourmohamad/BayesianOptimizationBook).
4. Extras: read the book by [Roman Garnett](https://github.com/rahmanda/bayesian-optimization-sources/blob/main/roman-garnett-bayesian-optimization.pdf)
